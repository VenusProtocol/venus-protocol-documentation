**Overview**

Isolated E-Mode enables the safe addition of new or highly volatile assets to the protocol, preventing any potential risks from spreading system-wide. Assets listed in this mode can serve as collateral exclusively for borrowing a predefined set of assets—usually stablecoins—subject to a fixed debt ceiling. This approach effectively isolates risk while broadening the range of supported assets.

When a user chooses to enable an asset Isolated E-mode group  

* Only specifically permitted assets can be borrowed.  
* Borrowing is capped through a conservative supply cap.  
* No additional assets can be used as a collateral.

This mechanism safeguards the protocol by restricting the total debt against higher-risk assets, thereby minimizing potential systemic impact.
