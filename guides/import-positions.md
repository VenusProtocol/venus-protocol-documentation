# Import Positions

### Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to import your supply positions from other DeFi platforms into the Venus Protocol.

### Steps for importing supply positions from other DeFi platforms)

#### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

* Click on the "Connect wallet" button in the top right corner of the Venus Bridge interface to connect your wallet.

If you have supply positions in other DeFi protocols (we currently only support Aave, with more to come soon) for which we can propose a better APY, a modal will automatically appear showing you options to import your positions to the Venus Protocol.

If you close this modal, it won't be shown to you ever again. You can still access this UI by selecting the "Import" item in the side menu.

#### Step 2: Initiate an Import

* Click on the "Import" button next to any position listed.
* A confirmation pop-up will appear in your wallet for you to approve the transaction. Note that this transaction is sponsored by the Venus Protocol, therefore it is free of charge.

#### Step 3: Confirm and Wait

* Confirm the transaction in your wallet. The interface will show the transaction as pending, indicating that it is being processed. This may take from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the current network activity.
* You can import all your positions one-by-one by repeating the process.

#### Step 4: Transaction Completion

* Once the transaction is complete, the new positions will appear in the "Account" page.
